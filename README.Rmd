# Disaster & Diversity <img src="man/figures/logo.jpeg" align="right" alt="" />

## Methods

We create a data pipeline to compute biodiversity indexes (Shannon Index and Simpson Index) for historical bushfire regions in Australia. The pipeline includes functionalities to:

  - Find the shape file for the postcode in the disaster data: `disaster_as_shape()`
  - Query species from the Atlas of Living Australia: `query_species()`
  - Split the occurrence data by year and month: `split_time()`
  - Calculate indexes from the biodiversity data: `calculate_idx()`
  - Plot calculated indexes: `autoplot()`

## Results

From the historical bushfire regions, we find two types of changes in biodiversity indexes before and after the bushfire events, where some regions the Shannon index changes from 6 to less than 4.5 and the Simpsons index changes from 0.99 to less than 0.9.
