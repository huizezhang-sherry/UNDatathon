[Slide] Accelerate progress towards the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals. 

The urgent and existential risks of the global ‘climate catastrophe’, according to Antonio Guterres, has dealt ‘a major blow to the UN SDGs implementation efforts' 

[Slide: Map of Australia & bushfire image]

We examined the impact on biodiversity of a major natural disaster that received international attention — the 2019–20 Australian bushfire season or Black Summer event.

Australia is the flattest, driest continent in the world. 

Australian bushfires represent some of the most intense and catastrophic fire seasons on record. 

Australia’s October 2023 rainfall was 65% below the 1961–1990 average. We are having the fifth-driest on record for October since the national dataset began in 1900, and the driest since 2002.

How we respond to natural disasters is considered an indicator, for better or worse, for many around the world. 

High-quality, data-driven research supports policies and legislation for ecosystem and biodiversity preservation. 

We come from five countries. 

Our team of PhD students and early career researchers have real-world and applied research expertise in data science, bioinformatics, data policy and governance, and Indigenous perspectives.

[Slide: SDG 15 - To protect, restore and promote sustainable use of terrestrial ecosystems, sustainably manage forests, combat desertification, and halt and reverse land degradation and halt biodiversity loss.]


Collaborations by diverse teams with backgrounds in data science, natural and social sciences, are key to achieving the Sustainable Development Goals. 

Our project aims to address SDG 15. 

We produced a quantitative analysis to support recommendations to achieve targets and indicators for SDG 15.5

Biodiversity is in crisis. Wild animals and plants are disappearing at rates never before experienced during human existence. 

Scientists predict that one million species are headed for extinction within the coming decades as a result of human activity.

[Slide - SDG 15.5 image - Protect biodiversity and natural habitats]

By taking urgent and significant action to reduce the degradation of natural habitats, we can halt the loss of biodiversity and protect & prevent the extinction of threatened species. 

This work will directly impact government decisions by generating an open data resource for ecological policymakers to reduce the burden of future natural disasters on wildlife.

[Slide: Biodiversity is the foundation of ecosystems that produce clean air, drinkable water, a healthy climate, medicines, and food.]

Biodiversity is the term researchers use to describe the full mix of life on Earth — From the tiniest insects to the tallest trees—and everything in between, including humans and our impacts on the natural world. 

It refers not only to the number of plants, animals, and other organisms, but their variety, which is  significant since each different species has an important part to play in the larger whole. 

[Slide: Biodiversity indices are valuable tools for decision-making and understanding the complex interactions within ecosystems.]

Biodiversity indices are a proxy measure of overall species diversity in a given region, and is an important measure for helping us understand natural barriers against many diseases, including diseases that can turn into pandemics.

For example, conservationists & environmentalists use biodiversity indices to assess the health and trends of ecosystems and species, ultimately to develop strategies to protect and restore biodiversity. 

Government agencies use these models to inform policy decisions, land management and conservation planning. 

Land planners and developers may use them to guide land-use decisions and ensure projects are environmentally responsible. 

Sustainable agriculture and forestry experts use biodiversity models to limit negative impacts on ecosystems such as habitat destruction and species loss. 

They are used by educators, researchers, NGOs and non-profits for environmental advocacy efforts. 

[Slide: Indigenous fire wardens]

Indigenous peoples often have a deep knowledge of their ecosystems and may use biodiversity models to complement traditional knowledge for their efforts to protect and manage Country and waterways. 

Planners and policy makers are guided by disaster models for assessing immediate and long-term impacts of bushfires, helping to coordinate response efforts, allocate resources, and plan for recovery and reconstruction in a data-driven manner.

[Slide: For many First Nations peoples, data collected on country and waterways is considered sacred & protected knowledge. 

Our project focused on the 2019–20 Australian bushfire season or Black Summer event.

If you’re not familiar with what happened… From September 2019 to March 2020, bushfires heavily impacted various regions of Australia. The most severe fires peaked from December 2019 to January 2020.

A massive fire characterised by its unusual intensity, size, duration, and uncontrollable dimension, was considered a megafire. 

What we did

Using open methods and open data, we examined how to better monitor and evaluate the impacts of natural disasters on our terrestrial ecosystems and biodiversity. We performed exploratory data analysis using data from the Digital Atlas of Australia and Atlas of Living Australia. 

By monitoring, measuring and evaluating biodiversity and natural habitats, we can reduce losses, ensure conservation, and protect genetic resources and more fairly share in the benefits of our terrestrial and ocean ecosystems. 

We looked at multiple fauna species and used Clarke & Warwick’s taxonomic distinctness index for biological community data. 

This index defines two biodiversity indices, capturing the structure not only of the distribution of species but also the taxonomic relatedness of each sample, giving us a richer image of the ecological landscape in a region.

For each bioregion, our team leveraged open data and R, one of the most widely used open-source programming languages for statistical data analysis. 

[Slide: Data types:  multivariate geospatial data, animal observations and bushfire event data.]

Using existing disaster indices, we performed a biodiversity analysis and produced visual plots using Python, R and MapBox.

[Slide: Open R package for exploring the impact of major disasters on ecological landscapes and biodiversity]

Our data pipeline package, “Disaster & Diversity”, calculates the ecological impact of natural disasters using biodiversity indices and the monetary costs of disasters. 

Our package can be used in combination with other metrics to monitor, measure and evaluate the impact of natural disasters. 

Our deliverable is an R package and includes a collection of functions to perform tasks including to:

- [x] Locate area from natural disaster open data. 
- [x] Extract the respective shape files. 
- [x] Query species from the Atlas of Living Australia.
- [x] Compute biodiversity indices, and 
- [x] Create visual plots using geospatial multivariate data.

Our functions can be called and used in other R scripts. Our packages include all the datasets we used. We have included documentation with information on how to use the functions and datasets. 

A core objective of Open Source Software is reuse. We associated the MIT open license with our R package. 

In doing so, we have achieved the objective of leveraging the work of others who came before us in the fields of biodiversity and disaster management. 

Through this project, we performed applied research on ecosystem resilience.

Accurate and up-to-date open data & multi-stakeholder collaboration are essential 

With the increasing frequency & scale of natural disasters, understanding, monitoring and evaluating these transnational events  require access to open data, open source platforms, and collaboration with multi-disciplinary teams.  

Open data is often made available as a public good. 

[Slide - logos for ALA & Global Bio Info, FAIR data standards]

The Atlas of Living Australia’s open data was central to our project. This open data atlas is an excellent example of collaborative, digital, open infrastructure.  It pulls together Australian biodiversity data from multiple sources, making it accessible and reusable. 

The Atlas of Living Australia  is the Australian node of the Global Biodiversity Information Facility – an international network and data infrastructure.

It is a network funded by the world’s governments and aimed at providing anyone, anywhere, open access to data about all types of life on Earth. 

The ALA uses the Darwin Core set of standards to mobilise and deliver biodiversity data.

Darwin Core is the internationally agreed data standard to facilitate the sharing of information about biological diversity.

It confirms to the FAIR data exchange principles.

In closing,

[Slide - Team photo + healthy ecosystems]

Our five-member Australian-based team of ECRs, hailing from four countries, produced tangible deliverables during the 3-day  Datathon. 

During this 2023 Datathon, we addressed SDG 15.5 by looking  looked at biodiversity loss in the aftermath of natural disasters. 

We showed that multidisciplinary collaborations are essential to conservation and sustainable ecosystems and biodiversity in Australia and beyond. 

Our team conducted analysis to calculate biodiversity indices that support monitoring & evaluation of bio regions & disaster impacts.
