154,Disaster Event,Bushfire - Black Tuesday Tasmania,"On 7 February 1967 over 100 fires were burning across southern Tasmania, which was to be known as 'Black Tuesday'.  Combination of abundant forest litter created by the prolific growth in the Spring of 1966, strong northerly winds of up to 110 km per hour and extremely hot air created ideal conditions for bushfires. The bushfires swept across the south-east coast of Tasmania and burnt through 264,270 hectares in the state's south in the space of five hours coming within 2 km of central Hobart. Sixty two people lost their lives, and 1400 homes or buildings were destroyed. The fires killed thousands of chickens and sheep among other livestock.  A Royal Commission after the fires found there were 110 fires burning within a 56 km radius of Hobart.  The Insurance Council of Australia estimated the 1967 damage at $14 million, with the 2011 estimated normalised cost of $610 million.",2/07/1967 0:00,2/07/1967 0:00,-43.16512299,146.2417603,,,,,,62,14000000,,,,1400,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,20000,,Tasmania,,http://www.emknowledge.gov.au/resource/?id=154,

127,Disaster Event,Flood - North and Central Queensland,"Queensland's far north endured saturating rains, cutting major transport lines and flooding isolated towns, leaving motorists and tourists stranded north of Ingham. Cairns opened a disaster co-ordination centre after a record 208 mm deluge which turned suburban streets into creeks and shopping centre car parks into miniature lakes. More than 3000 sandbags were distributed to Cairns residents who fought to keep rising flood waters from their front doors and 10,000 residents experienced blackouts.  Apart from floods along the Barwon, Tully and Herbert Rivers, others to flood included Burdekin, Bulloo, Flinders, Thompson, Paroo, Diamantina, Georgina, Barcoo rivers and Cooper Creek. Almost a third of Queensland was declared a natural disaster area by the State Government in the wake of the extensive flooding throughout northern, central and western Queensland. In relative terms one out of three individuals were directly affected by the floods.  Wide spread floods caused damage to plantations, crops and infrastructure, which resulted in several large damage estimates. This included $70 million to cane and banana industries compiled with $50 million to existing infrastructure.

269,Disaster Event,"Flood - Grafton, Kempsey and North Coast New South Wales","The development of a low-pressure system off the New South Wales North Coast caused torrential rain on 2 March, and dissipated into Queensland. Heavy rainfalls intensified over the following days, particularly in the Coffs Harbour and Port Macquarie regions.  River systems in the region were at capacity and tidal systems in correlation with the king tides caused further complexities with rising flood water. The following river systems were affected; Richmond, Clarence, Bellinger, Nambucca, Macleay, Hastings, Manning, Paterson and Hunter. The rising water exceeded levees in Kempsey and the traffic bridge at Kempsey peaked at a height of 6.9 m. Other significant damage included; 94 businesses with an estimated direct cost of $28,000 per business, streets closed to traffic and 100 people evacuated from the Mirriwina Gardens settlement (50 km north-west of Kempsey).  The Clarence River also threatened to exceed levees causing precautionary evacuations of more than 1000 people, including 80 patients from the Grafton Hospital. The Grafton levee bank was able to hold the water within the river system, which finally peaked at 7.75 m.  The effects of the flooding were wide spread and inundations and dislocation of services affected up to 28 local government areas.The Pacific Highway, the main route in many of these regions, was cut for several days. Rail services were also reported as suspended. Furthermore, reports of damage included; Yamba becoming isolated, Gladstone and Smithtown where sewerage infrastructure failed and Ulmarra (population of 470) was ordered to evacuate. Bellingen, Thora, Kaland and Darkwood, South West Rocks, Hat Head, and Crescent Head were isolated and required food and medical drops by helicopter.  The response units included; State Emergency Services (SES) a contingent of 1300 volunteers from 83 units, Rural Fire Service (RFS), New South Wales Fire Brigade (NSWFB), Volunteer Rescue Association (VRA), Police, and Council workers. Additional supporting equipment used in the response included; ten heavy tankers, 12 flood boats, and 11 helicopters.  Estimated costs to roads and bridges was $3 million, water and sewerage infrastructure $500,000.  The enormity of the recovery resulted in the Premier establishing a Government Task Force to coordinate the operation. Brigadier Philip McNamara was appointed the regional coordinator for the recovery, and was based in Coffs Harbour.

Subsequent heavy rain affected the Gold Coast and Logan City, with heavy rain falling over Brisbane City, producing areas of flash flooding, particularly across southern suburbs but also in the east and north. Intense rainfall was observed across the district for duration of approximately 6 hours.  Gold Coast and Logan City: A person drowned during the early morning hours of 11 March, when the vehicle in which they were passenger was swept off a road near Logan. Many homes and businesses were damaged by flash flooding. Flooding at Beenleigh also led to four houses being inundated with sewage.  Brisbane City: A person was confirmed drowned, after being swept away by flood waters on the evening of 9 March, when vehicle in which they were passenger was washed off a road at Lawnton (in Brisbane's north). The damage inventory included hundreds of cars, many shops and offices, and up to 600 homes.  Stones Corner, a suburb in inner-eastern Brisbane, was one of the worst hit areas. Metre-deep flooding entered East's League's Club, forcing 50 patrons to be evacuated. About 30 cars were submerged in the club car park. Many houses throughout Brisbane's southern suburbs were also flooded. Over 100 homes were inundated in Wishart (southern suburb). Heavy rain downed powerlines at Annerley, Woolloongabba, Greenslopes and Holland Park. A block of flats at Greenslopes had the roof torn off. Cars that were stalled on flooded roads caused peak-hour traffic chaos. Many cars that had been left in flooded streets floated away. A car dealership in Salisbury reported damage to about 50 vehicles.  Three flights were diverted from Brisbane Airport to the Amberley RAAF Base after lights along the Brisbane runway went out (due to lightning). A house boat, moored on Norman Creek in eastern Brisbane, was damaged. The northern suburbs of McDowall, Windsor, Ferny Hills, Arana Hills and Everton Hills also recorded severe water damage. In the northern suburb of Aspley,six new cars were swept from the yard of a car dealership and into Cabbage Tree Creek and another 80 new vehicles were damaged. Flash flooding caused problems in Everton Hills near Kedron Brook.  Sunshine Coast: A person was rescued from a vehicle that was washed into a waterway. Shops in the main street of Beerwah were flooded, trees came down on powerlines and cars were swept away. Numerous traffic accidents were reported. Flash flooding was also reported near Sunrise Beach, and at Noosaville, Nambour, Eumundi and Hunchy. Powerlines were brought down at Nambour.

374,Disaster Event,"Bushfire - North-Eastern Victoria, Alpine Region","The Alpine bushfires started on 8 January 2003, a day of Total Fire Ban. Lightning ignited 87 fires in the North-East and East Gippsland regions. Eight of these fires were unable to be contained; they joined together to form the largest fire in Victoria since the Black Friday fires in 1939. More than 40 fires were also started in New South Wales and Australia Capital Territory.  The majority of the area burnt in Victoria was public land, 1.19 million hectares of parks and forests, including 60 per cent of the Alpine National Park and 81 per cent of the Mt Buffalo National Park. Fire fighting efforts were made difficult in hard to access, remote forest terrain. Approximately 90,000 hectares of private land was burnt. The fires burnt nearly 800,000 hectares in New South Wales and Australia Capital Territory, bringing the total of land affected throughout the Australian Alps to approximately 2 million hectares. The immediate effects of the fires included reduced water quality and quantity, loss of vegetation and habitats, destruction of commercial timber infrastructure, damage to recreation and tourism infrastructure assets and destruction of cultural sites and farms adjacent to public land.  A Ministerial Taskforce, appointed by the Victorian Premier, announced a funding package of $70.6 million for recovery works on public land associated with natural and cultural assets and support for agricultural private landowners affected by the fires. This was the biggest bushfire recovery effort ever undertaken in Victoria at the time. The Bushfire Recovery Program for the environment and agriculture focused on four areas:  1. Asset repair or replacement in parks, forests and alpine resorts ($24.9 million)  2. Protection and restoration of water catchments and water supply ($23.9 million)  3. Restoration of ecological and cultural heritage values ($13.2 million)  4. Providing practical assistance for affected farm enterprises ($8.6 million) Assets lost or damaged included; 41 houses, 213 other structures, three bridges and 10,000 livestock.

379,Disaster Event,"Severe Storm - New South Wales, Victoria, Australian Capital Territory, Tasmania and South Australia","At the beginning of February 2005 a low pressure system brought severe storms to eastern Australia. The weather system resulted in record rainfalls to south-east Australia and abnormally low temperatures through much of the eastern half of the country.  New South Wales  On 2 February, many areas of New South Wales and suburban Sydney experienced hail and heavy rain. Some examples are:    Kellyville, hail 5 cm,  Blacktown, hail 4 cm,  Kings Langley, hail 3 cm,  Quakers Hill, hail 3 cm,  Greystanes, heavy rain and hail 4 cm,  Potts Hill, hail 2-3 cm,  Castle Hill, hail 4-5 cm,  Greenacre, hail 4-5 cm,  St Ives, heavy rain and hail 2 cm,  Wahroona, heavy rain and hail 3 cm,  Gosford, hail 4 cm and Terrigal hail 4-5 cm.    Flash flooding was seen in Bexley (metropolitan Sydney) and in North Ryde. A thunderstorm and possible tornado caused severe local wind damage, bringing down trees and power lines, resulting in power outages to thousands of homes.  The strongest wind gusts during the storm were felt at Bathurst with 93 km per hour, Scone 93 km per hour, Kurnell 94 km per hour and Newcastle 91 km per hour.  The unseasonal cold weather brought snow to some areas of New South Wales where approximately 10-15 cm snow fell in the Snowy Mountains and temperatures reached as low as minus 5&deg;C. On the Brindabella Ranges near Canberra and on the Southern Tablelands, several centimetres of snow settled on the ground. Record low maximum and minimum temperatures occurred over this period, especially in the southern areas of the state.  Victoria  Substantial rainfall was reported in many areas of Victoria with 24 hour rainfall totals exceeding 150 mm in many places. Rainfall in the Melbourne metropolitan area exceeded 100 mm with an all time 24 hour record for Melbourne set at 120.2 mm (the previous record was 108 mm).  The highest wind gusts were recorded at Wilson's Promontory with gusts of up to 148 km per hour. In the Melbourne area wind gusts to 104 km per hour were recorded at Fawkner and Beacon.  Extensive damage to buildings was reported and over 7000 requests for assistance were received by the SES and other emergency services over the following days.  Tasmania  During this storm, Tasmania experienced widespread damage particularly from wind gusts. The strong south easterly winds caused damage from Devonport to Bridport, Scottsdale and Winnaleah in the north-east, Binalong Bay on the East Coast, and to Flinders Island in Bass Strait. Port Sorell (near Devonport) reported many homes to be badly damaged in part due to falling trees.  Approximately 25 yachts in the Tamar River broke their moorings, with 14 reportedly destroyed, causing hundreds of thousands of dollars damage.  The Bass Strait ferry Spirit of Tasmania l was forced to return to Melbourne after sustaining damage in seas estimated at 20 m. The Spirit of Tasmania II was delayed on its voyage from Devonport to Melbourne, while the Spirit of Tasmania III broke its moorings in Devonport and was also slightly damaged.  Fruit crops sustained up to 50 per cent loss; particularly apple and pear growers. Damage was also sustained to poppy and grain crops.

17,Disaster Event,Severe Storm -  New South Wales East Coast Low,"In June 2007 there were five east coast lows off the coast of New South Wales. The first and most severe occurred over 8-9 June. Heavy rain, strong winds and large ocean swells resulted in widespread damage to coastal regions of the Hunter, Central Coast and Sydney Metropolitan areas. The Queen's birthday weekend east coast lows developed in a pre-existing trough of low pressure over the northern Tasman Sea. This trough was directing a humid north-east to south-east air stream across north-east New South Wales and there was a weak low analysed just off the coast near Coffs Harbour on 8 June. The low moved south along the New South Wales coast, before moving out into the Tasman Sea on 10 June 2007.  Thunderstorms caused record breaking flooding in Newcastle, with 164.6 mm of rain falling in 6 hours from 3 pm to 9 pm, causing many shops and businesses to flood and hundreds of cars to be stranded or swept away. This storm event is often associated with the grounding of the Pasha Bulker (a 40,000 tonne bulk carrier ship) which occurred on 8 June on Nobbys Beach in Newcastle and was not re-floated until 2 July. Approximately 6000 people were evacuated from Maitland (near Newcastle) when it was considered that a levee may have burst.  In the Hunter Valley it was reported as the worst flooding in 52 years. Major flooding in the Hunter River occurred from 8 to 13 June and in the Paterson and Williams River from the 8 to 9 June. Moderate flooding occurred in the Wyong, Colo and Nepean Rivers.

Areas of raised dust were reported from the western half of the state, with visibility down to 200 m in some places.  The heaviest rainfall totals were from Falls Creek (Rocky Valley Dam) with 50 mm and Wilsons Promontory with 26 mm. The storm sent vegetation and debris flying, caused major disruption to Melbourne traffic and public transport systems and&nbsp;extensive damage to the electricity distribution network. Lanes were closed on the Westgate bridge where wind gusts were close to 120 km per hour, many traffic lights were out and conditions on the roads were chaotic. Several boats were washed ashore at Mornington, where large waves were observed.  There were reports that two people died as a result of this storm in Victoria.  More than 9,500 requests for assistance were received by emergency service agencies across the State between 2-7 April 2008 as a result of this event.  The Department of Human Services (DHS) coordinated Red Cross and local government to support the community with recovery, distributing 864 personal hardship grants totalling $240,115.

492,Disaster Event,Chemical - Varanus Island Gas Explosion,"At approximately 1.30 pm on 3 June 2008, an explosion at the Apache Energy Varanus Island gas processing facility's 30 cm gas pipeline caused it to rupture and fires to start. Approximately 153 staff were evacuated from the plant. Nobody was injured, but the facilities were forced to close temporarily.  The incident caused Western Australia's domestic gas supply to be cut by 30 per cent, as the Varanus Island facility is a major exporter of gas to the mainland. The largest impact was felt by major industry partners of Apache Energy such as BHP Billiton, Rio Tinto and Burrup Fertilisers, but the disruption in gas supplies also affected small businesses. A survey by the Western Australia Chamber of Commerce and Industry found that of 300 businesses surveyed, almost half said they had been affected by the energy shortage.  The West Australian Government laid claims against Apache Northwest Pty Ltd and its co-licencees, Kufpec Australia Pty Ltd and Tap (Harriet) Pty Ltd for 'failing to maintain a pipeline in good condition and repair'. However after more than two years of litigation, the state government made a public statement that they were discontinuing the prosecution due to legal technicalities.

On 30 January, it was named Yasi by the Fiji Meteorological Service. On 2 February, it was upgraded to a Category 5 system and made landfall near Mission Beach (138 km south of Cairns) between midnight and 1 am (AEST) early on Thursday 3 February. It weakened to a tropical low near Mount Isa around 10 pm on 3 February.  In response to warnings about the expected severity of the cyclone, and possible storm surges, approximately 10,000 northern Queenslanders living in low-lying areas evacuated to more than 100 official evacuation centres. Significant numbers were accommodated in unofficial evacuation centres established by communities and church groups. Thousands of people left the area and sought refuge with family and friends.  Flights out of the region were fully booked. The entire hospital population, more than 300 patients, were evacuated to other regional hospitals and Brisbane by the the Australian Defence Force, Royal Flying Doctor Service and other methods.&nbsp; This was an unprecedented evacuation effort.  The eye of the cyclone passed over Dunk Island and Mission Beach between Innisfail and Townsville bringing significant winds, the highest estimated at 285 km per hour. Considerable damage occurred to the towns of Tully, Cardwell, Tully Heads, Innisfail, Ingham, Mission Beach, El Arish, Silkwood and Silky Oak and localities, however, the cyclone&rsquo;s worst impact missed the major centres of Townsville and Cairns. Overall, approximately 1000 people reported significant damage to their homes. Other impacts include power loss to more than 200,000 properties, cars were found metres away from where they were left and boats were piled on top of each other in some regions.  Rainfall totals for the 24 hour period to 9 am Thursday 3 February were 200-300 mm in the area between Cairns and Ayr, causing some flooding. A 5 m tidal surge was observed at the storm tide gauge at Cardwell. Other sea inundation occurred between the beaches north of Cairns and Alva Beach, and there was some inundation in parts of the city of Townsville.  The Australian Bureau of Agriculture and Resource Economics and Sciences estimated the cyclone caused a $300 million hit to agriculture, particularly affecting banana and sugarcane crops.  The Federal Government processed over $250 million worth of recovery grants in the first three weeks after the storm through Centrelink. Financial help was also available in the form of concessional loans for cyclone hit farmers up to $650,000.  There was one recorded death.

505,Disaster Event,"Severe Storm - Melbourne, February 2011","On 4 February 2011, severe thunderstorms developed over Victoria. Tropical moisture associated with Tropical Cyclone Anthony and ex Tropical Cyclone Yasi interacted with a persistent low pressure trough extending from central Australia, through Mildura and Melbourne, to north-eastern Tasmania.  Extremely high humidity and strong winds were associated with the storms which delivered record daily and multi-day rainfall totals to areas of north-east and south-east Victoria. The rain caused flash flooding in metropolitan Melbourne and prompted flood warnings for 24 rivers and creeks.  On the afternoon and evening of 4 February, a damaging microburst caused damage west of Melbourne at Laverton. Wind speed strengthened from calm to 131 km per hour in six&nbsp;minutes causing damage to vegetation and structures within an area of approximately one square kilometre.

3413,Disaster Event,Bushfire - Dunalley - Jan 2013,"In early January 2013 up to 40 fires were burning throughout Tasmania in hot windy conditions. The main fire that started near Forcett caused significant damage to local townships, particularly Dunalley, east of Hobart, where more than half of the town&rsquo;s buildings and a primary school were destroyed. Other significant fire fronts were located at Lake Repulse and Bicheno.  The Forcett fire was first reported in bushland outside the town heading towards Dunalley, on Thursday 3 January 2013 at approximately 2.00 pm. The fire escaped containment lines the following afternoon fanned by strong winds and burned towards the coast at several points. More than 100 properties were destroyed and 2500 hectares of land were burnt by the afternoon of 6 January. At least 80 properties were either damaged or destroyed in Dunalley and nearby Boomer Bay, approximately 20 houses were destroyed at Murdunna and 40 per cent of structures were lost at Connelly&rsquo;s Marsh. The fire threatened the town of Taranna and on 14 January 2013 a Victorian volunteer firefighter was killed when undertaking back burning operations in the vicinity. An estimated 24,000 hectares were burnt in the fire and at its peak the perimeter of the fire approximated 200 km.  Thousands of locals and tourists were stranded as a result of the Forcett bushfire which effectively cut the Tasman Peninsula off from the rest of the state. The peninsula's main access road, the Arthur Highway, was closed from 4&nbsp;to 13 January. People converged on Port Arthur to await evacuation by sea or road and due to shortages of food and other supplies, the community arranged for a fleet of boats to make deliveries to those stranded on the peninsula. Two private catamaran operators in Hobart were asked by police to help evacuate people from the Nubeena jetty.&nbsp; Evacuees were then taken to Hobart where they were met by relatives and friends or taken in by volunteers.  The Highway was partially opened on 11 January to allow stranded people and supplies to get through and was eventually opened to general traffic on 13 January.  Community refuges were established at the Sorrell Memorial Hall, Nubeena Community Centre, Bicheno Community Hall and Swansea Football Ground. There was also a Recovery Centre established at City Hall, Hobart.  The electricity company, Aurora, reported approximately 300 electricity poles were destroyed on the Tasman Peninsula, consequently power outages are expected to be an issue for a considerable time.  Australian Government Disaster Recovery Payments were made available to residents in the south-east and east of Tasmania, covering the affected local government areas of Sorell, Tasman and Glamorgan-Spring Bay. Other grants made available were immediate cash assistance grants, housing assistance grants, Aurora energy assistance and clean-up and assistance grants. A first stage recovery payment from the Red Cross Appeal Distribution Committee was distributed, providing $3000 per adult and $1000 per child by late January. The Department of Human Services has allocated over $7,845,000&nbsp;to cover approximately 6900 claims.  The Insurance Council of Australia advised as at 1 February 2013 that 1783 insurance claims had been received with losses estimated at $86.7 million, about 85 per cent of these related to property, seven per cent for domestic vehicles, with the balance consisting of smaller claims for other losses.  The fire at Lake Repulse burnt more than 12,000 hectares and threatened the towns of Ellendale Ouse, Karanja, Westerway and Hamilton. Police allege it was started by an unattended campfire. The fire burnt for up to two weeks and was handed back to regional firefighters when conditions eventually improved. The other significant fire front was at Bicheno and Coles Bay where up to 15 properties were lost.  These fires were described as the worst in almost half a century. On 14 January a Tasmanian Bushfire Recovery Taskforce was established and the state moved to recovery mode. The taskforce estimated that rebuilding communities could take up to two years, with contractors expected to start clearing damaged properties by the end of January.

By 8 January, there were over 100 fires burning, fueled by 40 degree Celsius temperatures.&nbsp;  The worst fire occured on 13 January when a fast moving bushfire in the Warrumbungle National Park near Coonabarabran destroyed more than 51 nearby homes and damaged many others. The lodge at the Siding Spring Observatory in the National Park was damaged along with other buildings. However, Australia's largest telescope the Anglo-Australian survived.  The other major areas affected by fire were Yass, Cooma and the Shoalhaven. One house was destroyed in Jugiong and a volunteer firefighter sustained burn injuries in Gundaroo and was airlifted to Sydney for hospital treatment.  A recovery centre was opened in Coonabarabran after the fire. A recovery coordinator was appointed on 21 January by Barry O&rsquo;Farrell concentrating on supporting the Warrumbungles fire affected community.  Approximately 131,000 hectares were burnt in total across the state and extensive farm infrastructure and fences damaged. Approximately 12,000 sheep were lost at an estimated cost of over $1,000,000. Wildlife losses were also significant. The Department teamed with farmers to establish a fodder and fencing donation register to assist farmers rebuilding after the fires.  On 15 January, the New South Wales Premier, Barry O'Farrell, and the Federal Minister for Emergency Management, Nicola Roxon, announced Natural Disaster Assistance would be available to 51 Local Government Areas in New South Wales affected by bushfires.

4790,Disaster Event,"Bushfire - Perth Hills, January 2014","The bushfire began in the Perth Hills on Sunday morning 12 January 2014 during the heatwave of 8 -13 January with consecutive days over 40 degrees Celsius. The excessive heat and strong winds fuelled the fire which quickly grew out of control and spread from Parkerville to Stoneville and Mount Helena. A total of 650 hectares were burnt.  Hundreds of people were evacuated from their homes and sought shelter at centres set up in Mundaring and Swan View. Many residents were unable to return and assess the damage to their homes until 15 January when the extensive clean-up of debris and fallen power poles was complete. As of 16 January, 450 homes were still without electricity. It is believed that the fire was started by a fallen power pole.  A man died on the Sunday while protecting his home.  Financial assistance and grants were made to eligible Perth Hills bushfire victims, with Australian Government Disaster Recovery Payments of $384,800 scheduled to be paid.  The West Australian government gave $1 million to the Lord Mayor&rsquo;s Disaster Appeal and announced anyone who lost their house would receive $3000 and those whose homes were damaged would&nbsp;receive $1000.

3487,Disaster Event,"Cyclone Oswald, Queensland & New South Wales, 2013","Tropical Cyclone Oswald formed in the Gulf of Carpentaria on 21 January 2013. It made landfall at night between Kowanyama,and Pormpuraaw on the west coast of Cape York Peninsula, as a weak category one system with winds up to 100 km per hour. The following morning, as the cyclone moved inland it was downgraded to a tropical low system. The low moved toward the east coast, near Cooktown on 23 January and then tracked slowly to the south-south-east just inland from the coast, impacting areas near Townsville on 24 January. The weather system stalled over the St. Lawrence-Rockhampton area on the 25th and 26th, and then tracked south to near Dalby west of Brisbane on the 28th, finally accelerating in a southerly direction eventually moving offshore south of Sydney on 29 January.  The ex-tropical cyclone brought with it a heavy monsoonal rainfall system that lasted for approximately one week. Most of the eastern areas of Queensland, and the coast of New South Wales ending in the Wollongong area experienced very heavy rainfall during the period from 22 to 29 January 2013. On 25 January, areas around Rockhampton recorded rainfall for a 24 hour period in excess of 300 mm. Rainfall for the areas between Rockhampton and Bundaberg alone were heavy enough to break the January monthly rainfall records. On 28 January, the most extreme daily rainfall for the week occurred over the Gold Coast Hinterland and New South Wales border catchment and the edge of the Brisbane river catchment where rainfall for a 24 hour period was in excess of 700 mm both hitting record levels. The Queensland State Emergency Service received 1800 calls for help in 24 hours on the 28 January, mostly in the south-east areas of the state.  Six people were killed due to the extreme weather over the course of the week. Thousands were forced to evacuate, 2000 people were isolated by floodwaters for some days requiring emergency supply drops. Approximately 40 water rescues took place by State Emergency Service volunteers.  Key infrastructure was damaged and destroyed, estimated to cost hundreds of millions of dollars. The rail service was closed between Cairns and Townsville, the Weipa port shut down for several days, airlines cancelled many domestic flights between New South Wales and Queensland, travellers were stranded as they tried to return home after the long weekend, 200 schools were closed on the first day of school for the year and the worst ever power outages occurred in Queensland affecting 283,000 properties.  On 27 January, the system moved south impacting Brisbane, the Gold Coast and Sunshine Coast with damaging to destructive winds, torrential rain, dangerous surf and tidal inundation for a 24 hour period. Winds reached 131 km per hour at Cape Byron.&nbsp;Mt Crosby water treatment plant was shut down owing to turbidity in the Brisbane River. Water was released from the Wivenhoe dam from 91per cent to 88 per cent to cope with flood waters. Water was also released from North Pine Dam and Somerset Dam.  Torrential rainfall and flooding also occurred in northern New South Wales particularly near Lismore and Grafton where approximately 2000 evacuations occurred. The New South Wales State Emergency Service attended to&nbsp;more than&nbsp;2900 calls for assistance Eight New South Wales river systems had flood warnings in place. Coastal erosion of beaches was evidenced in these regions along with sea foam covering some roads and parks on the Gold and Sunshine Coasts.  Overall, Bundaberg was the worst affected city with 2000 homes and 200 businesses inundated with flood water. The Burnett river was running at approximately 70 km per hour and threatening houses. Despite a mandatory evacuation order issued to 5000 residents, an emergency airlift was the only option for some stranded residents. Eighteen helicopters were utilised in a rescue effort evacuating more than 1000 people trapped by flood waters in North Bundaberg and other most-at-risk areas to at least nine evacuation centres which was a record evacuation effort in Australia. The Bundaberg hospital was also evacuated and approximately 130 patients were transferred to hospitals in Brisbane.  On 31 January, in North Bundaberg, approximately 7000 residents were forced out of their homes and not allowed to return until they were checked and declared safe. Defence personnel, 180 in total, went house to house within an exclusion zone, conducting search and rescue operations. Defence personnel also helped to repair damaged infrastructure and clean people's homes as part of the initial recovery operation.  Financial assistance and grants were made available to eligible Queensland flood victims, including:    Queensland Floods Appeal 2013 payments  Emergent Assistance Grant  Australian Government Disaster Recovery Payment (AGDRP)  Essential Services Safety and Reconnection Grant.

612,Disaster Event,Flood - New South Wales - 2012,"The combination of a high pressure system over the southern Tasman Sea and a trough over Queensland directed moist east to north-easterly winds across New South Wales. This generated patchy rain areas and isolated thunderstorms and heavy rain over the north of the state.  Minor to major flood warnings were issued for communities on the Mid North, Coffs Harbour and North Coast of New South Wales. There were reports of 300 mm falling in the space of three days in areas of the Bellinger River Valley and the Orara River catchment.  More than 2000 people were isolated by the rising floodwaters, with a number of road closures such as at the Pacific Highway and a caravan park in a low lying area evacuated.

More than 700 homes or businesses in the region needed assistance, and more than 440 were damaged with approximately 288 properties affected in Mitchell and 290 affected in Roma. One hundred and twenty Australian Defence Force soldiers assisted with the clean up in these regions.  On 5 February mandatory evacuations were ordered for St George after it was predicted the Balonne River would peak at up to 15 m. With more than 2600 people from a population of 3000 evacuated, it was Queensland&rsquo;s largest evacuation in history. The Balonne River in St George passed its previous record of 13.48 m, peaking at 13.93 m, but the township remained protected by its 14.5 m levee with damage restricted to the 50 homes. St George also faced pollution problems as floodwaters damaged the local sewerage treatment plant, posing a major public health risk.  At the beginning of March, a category one cyclone off the south-east coast caused further flooding and six evacuation centres were opened across the coast to assist evacuated and displaced people.  The National Disaster Relief and Recovery Arrangements (NDRRA) identified the Local Government Areas of Aurukun, Burdekin, Burke, Cairns, Carpentaria, Cassowary Coast, Charters Towers, Cook, Doomadgee, Hinchinbrook, Kowanyama, Mackay, Mapoon, Mornington, Napranum, Northern Peninsula, Palm Island, Pormpuraaw, Tablelands, Townsville City, Torres Strait Islands and Yarrabah as natural disaster zones. To date the Australian Government Disaster Recovery Payments total approximately $11,749,000 allocated to 10,293 claimants.  On 3 January one person died when their car was swept off a causeway into floodwaters in Roma. Another person died on 5 March after being swept away by waters near Gympie, north of Brisbane.  The Insurance Council of Australia estimated the preliminary 2012 damage at $124.7 million.

114,Disaster Event,Flood - Eastern Australia,"In January 1974 Queensland, and to some extent other states, incurred significant flooding, with large areas of the country inundated. In Brisbane a very wet 1973 occurred and the rains had already resulted in some flooding when, on 24 January, cyclone Wanda hit the north of the city.&nbsp;Wanda came with relatively little wind, but produced record rains over the Australia Day holiday. Over the long weekend, Brisbane received 580 mm of rain, with much higher falls over river catchments near the city (1,300 mm in five days at Mt Glorious). Approximately 40 houses situated on the banks of the rivers and creeks were washed away as rivers flooded to their highest levels since the 1893 floods.  Fourteen lives were lost in the floods and many people had to be rescued from rising waters.  Record floods were also reported in New South Wales with much of the state affected. In May 1974, record flood levels occurred in the Ovens and Maribyrnong rivers in Victoria. Many settlements in South Australia were also badly affected; Oodnadatta, Marree, Moomba, Iron Knob, Andamooka and Coober Pedy were cut off by flood waters. In Tasmania, floods in the St Marys area in March - April caused extensive damage.

Record flooding occurred in the Bulloo, Paroo, middle and lower reaches of the Flinders, Norman, Gilbert, Cooper, Diamantina, Georgina and Eyre rivers and creeks as well as Nerang, Brisbane City metropolitan, upper Brisbane, Bremer, Warrill and Logan rivers. By 29 January the Brisbane area had recorded 900 mm of rain. Brisbane also received 314 mm of rain in a 24 hour period surpassing the previous record established in 1931.  Six thousand houses were inundated by flood waters, where 56 were either completely destroyed or deemed uninhabitable. There was widespread damage to infrastructure including roads, railways and bridges as well as power lines, resulted in serious power failures throughout the affected regions. Business and industries sustained millions of dollars in losses due to the heavy deluge.

4781,Disaster Event,Bushfire - New South Wales 2013,"During October 2013, approximately 100 fires burnt across eastern New South Wales, including six major bushfires. The most serious fires started in the Blue Mountains on 16 and 17 October.  The fires began on 13 October when strong winds and high temperatures caused a fire near Port Stephens and destroyed six houses. Several sheds and cars were also burnt in the fires and dozens of residents spent the night in evacuation centres. One person died at Lake Munmorah while protecting their home. Fires also occurred around the Hunter and Hawksbury regions. At the same time, more than 100 firefighters were fighting bushfires at Tangory Mountain, Webbs Creek, Wollemi National Park, the Southern Highlands and the Central Coast.  On 16 October, a defence training exercise at Marrangaroo near the Blue Mountains, accidently sparked a fire that became known as the &lsquo;State Mine Fire&rsquo;. It had a perimeter of 190km and eventually burnt nearly 46,000 hectares between Lithgow and Mt Tomah. At its most severe, the fire travelled 25 km per hour through bushland.  Thousands of people in Lithgow were evacuated and the communities of Bell, Bilpin, Berambing, Clarence, Dargan, Hartley Vale, Mount Wilson were also affected. The fire devastated the recently restored tourist attraction, Zig Zag Railway, with equipment and train carriages destroyed.  On 17 October two more major fires began in the lower Blue Mountains: one near Mt Victoria and the other at Springwood. Wimallee and Yellowrock were the worst affected communities with 193 homes destroyed and 100 damaged. Staff and patients at the Springwood Hospital were evacuated as a precaution. With the three fires burning uncontrollably in the Blue Mountains, on 18 October, Victoria sent fire crews and equipment to assist with the NSW firefighting efforts. A State of Emergency was announced for NSW on 20 October.  By 22 October the State Mine Fire had travelled south and was threatening to join up with the Mt Victoria Fire. The Rural Fire Service decided to deliberately allow the State Mine Fire to join the Mount Victoria Fire in a controlled way by managing fuel loads and back-burning to create firebreaks. While this was a high risk strategy, by 25 October cooler weather conditions allowed firefighters to bring the three Blue Mountains Fires under control. The fires were declared extinguished on 13 November. A total of approximately 118,000 hectares was burnt across the state.  A second person died on 24 October while piloting a water-bombing plane that crashed over Budawang National Park.

460,Disaster Event,Hail - Port Broughton,"On 14 November 1979 Port Broughton sustained damaged by a line of ferocious storms that hit south-eastern South Australia. Very strong winds and hail ruined solid brick houses, holiday shacks and caravans. Cars were pushed sideways along the road. Pine trees up to 30 m tall were uprooted.  There was no loss of life during the event which was considered to be amazing. Eleven people were injured requiring hospital admission, 60 others required hospital treatment.  While Port Broughton incurred the most damage, other areas were also affected by this weather event. Destruction was felt from the mid north to northern Adelaide Plains. Clare experienced severe damage; houses lost their roofs and sheds were demolished in the high winds. Likewise the northern suburbs of Adelaide saw houses unroofed and the trees blown over in areas such Salisbury North, Parafield Gardens, and Munno Para.  The agriculture industry was severely impacted with crops damaged, glass houses broken, grape vines stripped, storage tanks squashed, orchards destroyed and many farmers livelihoods built up over many years were lost within ten minutes.  According to the Bureau of Meteorology Regional Forecasting Centre, the thunderstorm triggered by the trough line that extended across Yorke Peninsula moved over Port Broughton and produced destructive winds. The winds at all levels through the atmosphere were very strong. A thunderstorm is classified as severe if it produces wind gusts of 90 km per hour of more. On this day gusts were much higher with reports of 135 km per hour to 160 km per hour. Isolated large hail coming from very cold air high above the earth's surface was rapidly transported to the surface by downdrafts and accompanied the thunderstorms associated with the trough immediately to the east causing damage to some of Adelaide&rsquo;s northern suburbs.

Community meetings were undertaken, both pre-fire and during the fire events, which assisted in keeping the community informed.  The immediate effects of the fires were displacement of residents and tourists, closure of schools and loss of power supply to many properties. Longer term impacts include reduction in tourism trade; at least 112 staff were laid off as a result of the fires. The Wimmera Development Corporation estimated that tourism downturn resulting from the bushfire devastation will cost the Grampians regional economy up to $100 million.  The damage to environment and water catchments was significant. The Grampians and Gippsland fires had the greatest impact on water quality. Water authorities commenced both short-term and long-term risk management activities.  The Grampians fires also affected over 240 km of roads across the local and state road network. The most significant damage to the road network occurred on the forest road system, including 1200 km of forestry roads affected in the Grampian's National Park.

237,Disaster Event,Cyclone Bobby,"Cyclone Bobby travelled south along the west coast of Australia and passed near Onslow. It caused considerable damage to homes and buildings bringing heavy rains which flooded roads, damaged bridges, and caused damage to crops. The mining industry was severely affected.  The cyclone moved slowly and erratically along the Pilbara coast crossing just to the east of Onslow. The highest recorded wind gust was 183 km per hour at Onslow. A gust of 166 km per hour was recorded on Varanus Island off the Western Australian coast. Very heavy rainfall accompanied Bobby, with more than 400 mm of rain falling in the Onslow area.  Very minor property damage was reported from the Karratha area. Approximately 20 houses at Onslow sustained superficial roofing damage. Pastoral stations along the track between Onslow and Gascoyne Junction reported property damage.  Seven lives were lost when two fishing trawlers sunk off the coast from Onslow, and a motorist&nbsp;drowned while attempting to cross a flooded creek at Canarvon.

615,Disaster Event,Flood - Victoria February 2012,"Heavy rain began in Victoria on 26 February 2012. A severe weather warning for flash flooding was issued for most of the state, including the South West, North Central, Northern Country, Wimmera, Mallee, Central, West and South Gippsland and North-East forecast districts.  The State Emergency Service (SES) responded to 650 calls for help across the state on the last days of February following heavy rain and thunderstorms. There was flash flooding and minor building damage across the state after rainfalls of between 50 and 100 mm. In towns such as Seymour there was 120 mm of rain causing flash flooding and road closures. Shops in the main street of Chiltern were flooded after 94 mm of rain fell. The Goulburn Valley Highway was closed north of Seymour due to rainfall. Broken Weir near Benalla recorded the highest rainfall with 167 mm. Castlemaine received 50 mm of rain in a 90 minute period. Police said 11 homes and six shops were flooded.  State Emergency Service (SES) crews were also kept busy dealing with flash flooding at Yarrawonga, Cobram and Shepparton. In addition they had over 350 calls for help in Melbourne, with the hardest hit areas including Brimbank, Doncaster, Emerald and Malvern. There were 89 calls for help in the Ballarat area when storms dumped almost 60 mm of rain. The Daylesford Hospital had some minor flooding, and streets and at least one building were flooded in the area.  On 1 March 2012, the Bureau of Meteorology issued a Severe Weather Warning for heavy rain for residents in the Northern Country, East Gippsland and North East forecast districts.  Broken Creek&nbsp;broke its banks&nbsp;and flooded the town of&nbsp;Numurkah, north of Shepparton.&nbsp;Numurkah Base Hospital and the adjoining Karinya Nursing Home both experienced flooding, with&nbsp;patients and residents evacuated.&nbsp;Flood waters peaked on 5 March and slowly receded with a State Emergency Service spokeswoman saying it would take at least a week for the water to recede completely. Approximately 40 homes and businesses were damaged. The hospital was later delared unsalvagable and limited services resumed from a temporary tent facility, followed by longstanding portables.  Locals and the SES in Nathalia constructed a temporary metal levee with thousands of sandbags, 750 m in length along the banks of Broken Creek, in an attempt to protect the town. Nathalia's temporary levee was purchased after floods hit the town in 1993; it has not been used until this event and it supplements a permanent levee around much of the Nathalia stretch of Broken Creek. Notwithstanding the levee the SES still issued an evacuation order for the town of Nathalia as some doubt existed as to the levees ability to contain the flood waters.  Flooding of Broken Creek, which flanks Nathalia, peaked on 9 March at 3.25 m. The town's evacuation notice was lifted 15 March 2012 and the metal levee dismantled on 20 March 2012.  To date the Australian Government Disaster Recovery Payments total approximately $7,773,000 allocated to 6897 claimants.

545,Disaster Event,Cyclone Steve,"Cyclone Steve formed in the northern Coral Sea, near Willis Island, and developed into a cyclone at approximately 7 am on 27 February 2000. The cyclone intensified further during the day to reach Category 2 intensity by 1 pm, before crossing the east Queensland coast to the near north of Cairns at approximately 7 pm.  Cyclone Steve caused major flooding between Cairns and Mareeba. A record flood level of 12.4 m was reached at Mareeba at 4.37 am on 28 February 2000, with 90 people requiring evacuation and the railway bridge washed away. Many buildings in Cairns suffered severe water damage including the Cairns Hospital. Wind gusts of up to 150 km per hour caused several buildings in Cairns and Kuranda to lose their roofs. Hundreds of trees were uprooted and powerlines were brought down throughout the district, disrupting supplies to more than 40,000 residents. The two highways to the Atherton Tablelands were closed by fallen trees and landslides. Crop damage by floods and winds was severe, notably the sugar cane industry.  Cairns Emergency Services answered over 1200 calls during the course of Cyclone Steve, while the Disaster Coordination Centre took another 1800 calls. One person from the town of Cardwell was killed by the floods following the cyclone.  The Insurance Council of Australia estimated the 2000 damage at $11 million, with the 2011 estimated normalised cost of $31 million.

345,Disaster Event,Cyclone Vance,"Cyclone Vance developed off the coast of Darwin between 17 and 18 March, intensifying as it tracked to the west south-west then to the south before crossing the coast near Exmouth on 22 March as a Category 5 system. Wind speeds were recorded at 267 km per hour at Learmonth and 174 km per hour at Onslow. By the 23 March at 4 am it was near the town of Mount Magnet and was moving southeast at 50 km per hour.  Cyclone Vance was downgraded to Category 1 and passed to the northeast of Kalgoorlie on the 23 March 2011 at approximately 3 pm.  The storm surge associated with Cyclone Vance caused severe erosion of the beachfront and marina at Exmouth and stranded three large barges on the edge of Beadon Creek at Onslow. The storm surge at Exmouth was measured at 3.5 m which resulted in a storm tide of 4.9 m.  Severe structural damage occurred to approximately 10 per cent of buildings in Exmouth; many more experienced less obvious damage due to the intrusion of rainwater. Other damage was recorded in the far west of Pilbara, including damage in the town of Cue. Water and power supplies throughout the Gascoyne and Goldfields were disrupted and many homesteads sustained wind or flooding damage. The main rail and road links to the eastern states were cut.

448,Disaster Event,Cyclone Larry,"Severe tropical Cyclone Larry crossed the tropical north Queensland coast near Innisfail during the morning of 20 March 2006. Between Babinda and Tully, damage to infrastructure and crops was extensive, with the total estimated loss upwards of half a billion dollars.  In north-west Queensland, heavy rainfall from the cyclone caused several townships to be isolated for a number of days and, as a result, food drops were required and emergency supplies had to be delivered by helicopter. The banana industry in the region was almost wiped out, losing about 200,000 tonnes of fruit, worth about $300 million, representing approximately 80 percent of Australia's banana crop. The storm also destroyed at least $15 million worth of avocados.

Severe storms moved through Perth between 3.30 pm and 6 pm with large hail at record levels, heavy rain and severe winds that resulted in considerable damage.  The storm was responsible for record numbers of power outages more than&nbsp;150,000 properties were without power at the peak, 300 hazard incidents and affected flight, train and bus services. The number of requests for assistance from FESA and SES totalled more than 3000, the most significant number since the May 1994 wind storms. Approximately 15 schools in the northern suburbs were closed the following day due to damage, while many hospitals were also damaged.  Large hail occurred in a strip from the northern coastal suburbs to south Perth. For many suburbs, particularly from Osborne Park to Crawley, hail from 4-6 cm was large enough to badly damage cars, break car windscreens and windows of houses.&nbsp;Hail blocked gutters and drains worsening the impacts of flooding. Many properties were inundated with water including the University of Western Australia's library. A landslip at Kings Park caused the evacuation of several apartment towers as mud inundated lower levels threatening their stability.

More than 300 mm of rain fell in the western MacDonnell Ranges, with over 150 mm at stations further east, around Alice Springs. The flood reached a gauge height of 3.98 m.  The Todd River burst its banks, flooding large areas of Alice Springs, and isolating it from the south as road and rail links through Heavitree Gap were cut. Further south, the Hugh and Palmer Rivers also burst their banks, cutting the Stuart Highway.  The weather system which caused the flood resulted from the combined effects of two tropical depressions, one forming to the north-east of Darwin, and the second in the Indian Ocean south of Java. The combined depression then travelled in a south-easterly direction to Alice Springs.  Approximately 300 people were evacuated from low-lying areas, and there was considerable damage in the Alice Springs area. There were three fatalities in the floods.

Already saturated catchments were inundated and major flooding quickly developed on the Warrego and Maranoa Rivers and many other inland systems. The towns of Jericho and Augathella were flooded and a section of the Longreach railway was washed away.  On the morning of 21 April, the Warrego River was rising rapidly. Later the same day the river peaked at over 8.5 m which was 1.5 m above the previous record. Levee banks protecting the town were ineffective and floodwaters spread through the town, necessitating the entire population of 3500 to be evacuated to the airport. Many residents climbed to their rooftops and had to be rescued by helicopter.  The low then moved south-east and torrential rains were experienced across large areas of New South Wales west of the Divide. There was major flooding on the Lachlan, Macquarie and Castlereagh Rivers, among others. The Bogan river flooded into Nyngan. Despite the residents' ttempts to raise the levee banks by sand bagging, the levees could not withstand the flood and on the 23 April, as the river surged to 5.2 m, nearly one metre higher than the previous record, most of the town was inundated. The population of 2500 was evacuated to Dubbo, 160 km away.  The low then moved towards Victoria and produced torrential rains over Gippsland on 20 and 21 April with up to 350 mm recorded over the two day period.

18,Disaster Event,Flood - Gippsland June 2007,"In late June 2007, the Gippsland area received record rainfall associated with an intense low pressure system. The substantial rain event followed the Great Divide Bushfires, when 1.2 million hectares of public and private land were burnt and large areas of soil were left exposed.   The storm in June 2007 resulted in major flooding and widespread damage. Seven rivers burst their banks causing millions of dollars of damage to homes, businesses and farms, as well as a significant loss of public and private assets. The rapidly rising floodwaters forced dozens of rescues and evacuations. One person died as a result of the flood waters. During 48 hours of torrential rain more than 1000 emergency service staff worked to save homes and shops in towns throughout Gippsland. Relief centres were set up at Bairnsdale, Lakes Entrance, Paynesville, Sale, Lucknow and Loch Sport and housed up to 360 evacuees. Volunteers also provided medical aid and catering with other organisations such as the Lions Club.  The State Government established a Flood Recovery Ministerial Taskforce, which assessed community need and planned the recovery program. The Taskforce announced a $60 million Flood Recovery Initiative covering among other things the cost of work on some 400 roads, bridges and 80 walking tracks spanning hundreds of km and clearing debris from the regions&rsquo; water supplies, catchments and recreation areas.  The Insurance Council of Australia estimated the 2007 damage at $15 million, with the 2011 estimated normalised cost of $18 million.",6/27/2007 0:00,7/02/2007 0:00,-38.2273941,146.7471313,,,,,,1,15000000,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Victoria,,http://www.emknowledge.gov.au/resource/?id=18,

201,Disaster Event,Flood - Sydney and Wollongong,"During the period between 17-18 August, a low pressure trough moved along the central and southern New South Wales coast causing heavy rainfall. On 17 August between the hours 6:00 pm to 9:00 pm, a thunderstorm remained over the Wollongong area dumping heavy falls. Due to the flash flooding, many areas were isolated until 9:00 pm.  As a result, major roads and train lines to Wollongong were disrupted and mudslides were reported on some roads, including Bulli Pass. Fifty homes were flooded in north Wollongong, and it was reported homes along the coast were dislodged from their foundations. One person drowned in attempting to cross a flooded creek at Bellambi.  Damage recorded in Sydney suburbs included; erosion of beach side suburbs, 14 metropolitan roads blocked, power loss to thousands of homes, reports of winds reaching up to 92 km per hour which brought down trees and power lines.  Due to the impact of the flood, the State Emergency Services (SES) obtained access to the Natural Disaster Relief Arrangements (NDRA) funding which assisted in the response efforts. During the cleanup operation up to 450 personnel assisted and 41 SES volunteer units sent teams into Wollongong.

3495,Disaster Event,Chemical - Coode Island,"On 21 August 1991 at approximately 2.17 pm, an explosion occurred on Coode Island in Melbourne when a 600,000 litre chemical storage tank filled with acrylonitrile exploded and caught fire. The fire burned various hazardous chemicals including acrylonitrile, phenol, methyl ethyl ketone and benzene forming clouds of potentially toxic black smoke up to 30 km from the site, prompting the evacuation of Footscray Primary School, nearby buildings and ships, and closure of roads. People were advised to stay inside with windows and doors closed to avoid smoke inhalation. Testing conducted later showed that the smoke was not a chemical hazard due largely to the heat of the fire and high winds helped to dissipate the smoke from the area.  It took 155 fire fighters approximately three hours to gain control of the fire and two were injured in the process. The following morning at approximately 11.45 am, a ruptured pipeline caused an explosion in another storage tank that sent a fireball into the sky. This fire spread to four other storage tanks and burned until control was gained at around 4 pm. Fire fighting efforts alone were estimated to cost $2 million as the fire control required large quantities of foam.  In total, approximately 16 chemical storage tanks were damaged or destroyed, with approximately 8.6 million litres of chemicals burnt and more leaking.  A Coronial Inquest was held 26 April 1994 to 20 May 1994, where 59 witnesses presented evidence. The findings of the Coronial Inquest were released 17 June 1994. The Coroner found on the balance of probabilities that a corona discharge occurred, igniting the chemicals within Tank 80. A corona discharge, colloquially known as St Elmo's fire, is akin to lightning, but in slow motion and with a much lower discharge of energy. The Coroner praised fire fighters and other emergency service personnel for their efforts in the response.  Damage and clean-up costs were later assessed at between $20 and $35 million. The owner of the facility was charged under environment protection and labour laws with the penalty imposed in the vicinity of $1.3 million. According to the Financial Review the owners held an insurance cover of $20 million which covered the replacement value of the facility in addition to public liability insurance. Therefore, the insurance cost of Coode Island is assessed as $21.3 million.",8/21/1991 11:36,8/22/1991 11:36,-37.81663132,144.916626,,,,,,,21300000,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Victoria,,http://www.emknowledge.gov.au/resource/?id=3495,
